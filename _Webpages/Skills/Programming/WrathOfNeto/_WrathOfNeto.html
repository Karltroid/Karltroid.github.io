	<h2>
		Wrath of Neto
	</h2>
	In my freshman year of Computer Programming & Web Development, in the beginning of the year we were introduced into programming by using a program called "Alice." It was sort of like another "learn to program" application called Scratch, they both use
	block coding, but alice is 3D and much more advanced. Making a game that isn't terriable in Alice is very hard, but I tried my best. The game I made for my project was called "Wrath of Neto." The idea of the game is simple, just go around and kill the monster
	Netos! (Neto is based on one of my friends) In my opinion, the models and animations in Alice are horrible so I decided to take an approach like DOOM did where its a 2D sprite that is always facing towards you, allowing me to make my own animations.
