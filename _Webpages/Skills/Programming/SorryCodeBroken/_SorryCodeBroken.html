		I'm Sorry, but the Code Is Broken
	</h2>
	In my freshman year of Computer Programming & Web Development, near the end of the year we were assigned groups to make either a game or website, showing/teaching what we learned in that
	school year. For my group she put the most talented kids in it so we were able to make something amazing. For my ALE(independent work when we are done with our assignments the teachers
	give us) I did Unity & C#, my partner Ben did Blender modeling, and my other partner Matt did a little bit of everything, Unreal Engine 4, Unity, and a tiny bit of scripting. We took all those
	things we learned in our own time and put them into our project about what we learned from our teachers. So what we did was we had 1 weekend to make an entire game in Unity (using C# for scripts)
	and present it the next monday in class, which by having no sleep and only working on that, we accomplished! The idea of the game is that it's just a normal side scroller but as you go through
	the game you have to use alice "code" to fix the things that are broken. Since we built it only in a weekend there are some bugs in it still, like sometime the jumping will not work and if the
	resolution isn't a 16:9 aspect ratio then the UI may break, but I kind of find that funny since it supports the name of the game. (hehe)
