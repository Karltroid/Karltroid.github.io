		Past Job: Honey Pot Hill Orchards
	</h2>
	At Honey Pot Hill Orchards I did many various tasks when I first started like stocking the main store with apples pears, 
	apple cider donuts, carmel apples, corn, apple cider, water and much more as the items were quickly being bought out, next
	I worked in the food line where I made Chilli Cheese hot dogs along side other workers making different foods in a line of
	people varrying from 10 to 40 at almost all times, and I also worked in the kitchen for a bit when they were short on workers
	due to it being a holiday and I came in to work right when my school's half day was over. In the kitchen I was mainly bagging
	warm/fresh plain and cider donuts in a line of at least 100 people, I also helped out the workers who were making the donuts
	by getting them the ingrediant they needed when they ran out. The last small job I did before I figured out what my main task
	I wanted to do was working the register in the smaller food area where we sell things like ice cream and hot cider. In this task
	I had to do things that you would expect when working the cash register like taking the customers order, telling the other
	workers what it was so they can make it, using the cash register to calculate the total and taking the customer's money and 
	calculating in my head what the change I had to give back was is if any. Lastly the last new job I did and the one I would be
	doing for the next 2 years was security at the main lot(Lot A) and sometimes B/C if they needed me there for some reason. For
	this job/task I had to keep an eye on every single person the was entering the apple picking area, making sure that the bag they
	are holding isn't empty with a sharpie mark on it (that I would make, explained later and if the bag they are holding has the 
	right colored handle for that day (the handle on the apple picking bag people buy changed every day so we knew they just bought
	it) and whenever someone wanted to exit the apple picking area I had to mark their bag at the level of where the apples were filled
	up to in the bag. We did this so people couldn't just dump the apples they picked in their car and come back with the same bag, 
	which was a huge problem as one day (before I started working there) they found that in the back of someones car it was filled with
	hundreds of apples; From that day forward thats when they opened up the security position.
